# Energy-SchNet-Replication
Energy-SchNet-Replication is a minimal PyTorch implementation of SchNet focused solely on molecular energy prediction. It models atomic interactions using continuous-filter convolutions and atom-wise updates, producing rotationally invariant total energy without predicting forces.
